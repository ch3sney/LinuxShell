# linux-shell

Created as part of CSE2431: Operating Systems II

Custom CLI shell which allows for multithreading and storing of command history. Served as a good exercise in operating systems programming and lower level C programming. Please pardon any ugly syntax, etc., this was for a homework assignment and hence was pretty rushed :)
