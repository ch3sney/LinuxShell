CSE 2431 - Lab 5 Readme

Hello! Compiling the program should be as simple as running the "make" command.
In terms of running the program, you can just type "mysh". The history file defaults to "chesney18.history", but feel free to change this in the shell.c file. It's the variable named "history_file". 

Hope this helps and thanks for checking out my submission!
